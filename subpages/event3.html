          <h3>FILM TALK : A Special 6 Part Series</h3>
          <p>SHOW TIME: December 11, January 8, February 12, March 11, April 8, May 13 12am-7:30pm</p>
          <p>Theatre: Princess Twin</p>
          <p>Film Talk is a 6 month series of first-run films and moderated discussion being held at the Princess Twin on the second Wednesday of the month. The cost is $150 for the 6 film series.</p>
          <p>Doors open at 9:00 am – screening starts at 9:30. Tickets can be purchased at The Princess Twin Cinemas  Monday – through Friday from noon to 7:00 pm; weekends during screenings. This series is sold as a package; tickets are transferable.</p>
          <p>Coffee (supplied by Princess Cafe) and fresh baked pastries (provided by Red Circle Coffee) are available and included in admission cost.</p>
          <p>Following the screening, we will have a moderated discussion with a panelist who can help unpack the themes in the film and provide additional context, or a more local lens. The discussion and Q&A will last approximately 40 minutes.
          While you will not know what the film is until the curtain rises, it will be a film that has not been in general distribution and has only been screened in the Festival circuit (TIFF, Cannes, Sundance, etc).
          Why won’t we tell you the film title? Partly because it adds to the fun, and partly because it allows us much more freedom to select films as they become available.</p>
