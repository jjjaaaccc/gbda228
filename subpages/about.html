        <h2>The 'original' Princess Cinema</h2>
        <p>Our first location - a single screen cinema -  now called the Original Princess Cinema, was opened in 1985 at 6 Princess Street West, behind the Huether Hotel.The Original Princess Cinema still maintains a "calendar art-house" programming model, which exhibits the best in international, independent and Canadian cinema, as well as festival hits, documentaries, mini-festivals, Hollywood classics, cult films and special series. Audiences can expect eclectic programming at the Original Princess, and more mainstream bookings at the Princess Twin cinemas. The Original Princess also features our Live on Stage concert series. We publicize our offerings at the Original Princess Cinema with a bi-monthly newspaper guide, in addition to our web-site. The Original features comfortable high-back chairs and a truly funky, independent vibe. This 177-seat cinema is located on the second floor of an historic 19th century brewery building.</p>

        <h2>Princess Twin Cinema</h2>
        <p>In 2003, we spread our wings and purchased the Alan Rigby House of Furniture in Uptown Waterloo, and over the course of two years, converted the two-storey retail space to a twin cinema with stadium seating. Officially the Princess Twin cinemas started screening movies in January 2005. The Twin is just around the block from the Original at 46 King Street North.Unlike the Original Princess, the Twin Cinemas screen new choices every week and has the ability to hold popular hits for weeks, even months! Uptown Waterloo audiences get a chance to see a mix of quality, popular mainstream cinema, as well as fresh looks at new, specialty films at the Twin Cinemas. Some unique features of the Twin is its spacious lobby for receptions and parties, the Princess Cafe, which offers the popular Dinner & a Movie combo, and the Odeon Gallery, which displays monthly exhibits by local artists.</p>
